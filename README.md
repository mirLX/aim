The AIM Ledger is a decentralized cryptographic ledger powered by a network of peer-to-peer servers. The AIM Ledger uses a novel Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm to settle and record transactions in a secure distributed database without a central operator.
AIM is a ripple-protocol-based financial network to promote and develop the fastest and least expensive payment settlements systems on a global scale. It enables payments in all types of currency as easy as sending email.

As the core component of the AIM network, the underlying AIM is a series of servers that run peer to peer software. Anyone can freely set up a AIM server to being accepting or receiving payments. AIM network introduces a first native currency 'AIM' which is designed to promote the spread and adoption of the AIM network through a reward program. The reward program will be scheduled daily to distribute the pre-defined currency fairly to every eligible user. Using AIM is free and the AIM network is owned by every participant.

Key Features of the AIM Ledger

[Censorship-Resistant Transaction Processing][]: No single party decides which transactions succeed or fail, and no one can "roll back" a transaction after it completes. As long as those who choose to participate in the network keep it healthy, they can settle transactions in seconds.

[Fast, Efficient Consensus Algorithm][]: The AIM Ledger's consensus algorithm settles transactions in 4 to 5 seconds, processing at a throughput of up to 1500 transactions per second. These properties put AIM at least an order of magnitude ahead of other top digital assets.

[Finite AIM Supply][]: When the AIM Ledger began, 513 billion AIM were created, and no more AIM will ever be created. (Each AIM is subdivisible down to 6 decimal places, for a grand total of 100 quintillion drops of AIM.) The available supply of AIM decreases slowly over time as small amounts are destroyed to pay transaction costs.

[Responsible Software Governance][]: A team of full-time, world-class developers at AIM maintain and continually improve the AIM Ledger's underlying software with contributions from the open-source community. AIM acts as a steward for the technology and an advocate for its interests, and builds constructive relationships with governments and financial institutions worldwide.

[Secure, Adaptable Cryptography][]: The AIM Ledger relies on industry standard digital signature systems like ECDSA (the same scheme used by Bitcoin) but also supports modern, efficient algorithms like Ed25519. The extensible nature of the AIM Ledger's software makes it possible to add and disable algorithms as the state of the art in cryptography advances.

[Modern Features for Smart Contracts][]: Features like Escrow, Checks, and Payment Channels support cutting-edge financial applications including the Interledger Protocol. This toolbox of advanced features comes with safety features like a process for amending the network and separate checks against invariant constraints.

[On-Ledger Decentralized Exchange][]: In addition to all the features that make AIM useful on its own, the AIM Ledger also has a fully-functional accounting system for tracking and trading obligations denominated in any way users want, and an exchange built into the protocol. The AIM Ledger can settle long, cross-currency payment paths and exchanges of multiple currencies in atomic transactions, bridging gaps of trust with AIM.
